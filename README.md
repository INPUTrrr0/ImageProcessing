In the field of anime drawing, many people uses line art drawing to practice coloring methods. But sometimes it is hard to find the line art you like. It can be beneficial if they can convert their favorite screenshot and pictures they like into clear line art.  
In this edge detection method, I used Prewitt algorithm. 

I used three different pictures with different levels of clarity of line art to demonstrate the effect of this algorithm at detecting the edge and isolate the line art.
Picture with clear line art have dark and dense lines. The seperation between colors are obvious.
Picture with blurry line art have light and thin lines. The seperation between colors are not clear.
